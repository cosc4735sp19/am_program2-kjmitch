Description:  (how to run the program, phone/emulator screen size, android version ie 7.0)

Anything that doesn't work:

# Graded: 25/50 #

* Cannot take a picture **(-15 points)**
* Pictures do not show up as map markers (given the previous problem) **(-5 points)**
* You cannot view a picture again after it is taken (again, given the previous issues) **(-5 points)**

Luckily, half the points were tied to simply having the map up and running, which you did have. In the future, please get started early and ask questions if you are having difficulties!
